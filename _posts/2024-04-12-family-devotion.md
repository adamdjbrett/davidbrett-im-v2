> *These were the sons of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Joseph, Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad and Asher*. ~ 1 Chronicles 2:1-2

It is so interesting to note that throughout the Bible we read chapters that describe who is related to who. In some cases it is a long list and goes back many generations. In Matthew 1 we read the lineage of Jesus. This list goes back all the way to Abraham, and then in Luke 3 the lineage of Jesus goes all the way back to Adam.

It seems to me that family is important to God. I would note that an important dimension of the trinity is that it is relational. There is a very striking relational component to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. We also read in the Genesis narrative that Adam was made in the image and likeness of God and that God "breathed" into Adam and he became a living soul. God has breathed into us this need for each other. Even after the Fall in Genesis 3 family remains intact although it is now radically corrupted because of sin. God even uses a family to bring his son Jesus into the world.

Family is the first place that we belong. Although we have been given the freedom to choose so many things in life, we do not choose our family, our parents, our brothers, and sisters. I would say that God chooses the family we are part of. For better or for worse.

I would also want to note that the church is emblematic of family. It is the family of the redeemed. It is a place to belong. To be accepted. A safe place to go to and be part of when life falls apart. It is a place of healing when your earthly family falls apart or is toxic and not good for your soul. In this family, the family of God, we all have the same older brother -- Jesus. He looks out for us. He is there for us. He sends the Holy Spirit to help and walk beside us throughout life.

Lord Jesus I am struck with a sense of awe that I get to be part of the family of God. That I have brothers and sisters around the world that are my "blood relatives" through Jesus Christ my Lord. Help me to do a better job of introducing this family to those who are not part of it -- yet. In Jesus name, amen.
