David J. Brett throughly enjoys any opportunity to teach, especially in churches, colleges, and in chaplaincy settings. He thrives on connecting with people and encouraging them to think through the lives that they are constructing for themselves.
  
He loves speaking and preaching in a dynamic setting as Village View Community Church. He speaks on rotation on Sunday Mornings and Wednesday evenings. Sunday mornings focus on biblical teaching in casual lecture style, whereas Wednesday evenings is a much more dynamic "flipped classroom" approach to Bible Study and theological training and teaching. Here are few of the "greatest hits" of David speaking on Sunday.
