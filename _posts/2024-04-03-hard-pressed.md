> *We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.*
>~ 2 Corinthians 4:7-10
* * *

Paul is writing to the church at Corinth. He is trying to help them understand the nature of the Christian life. It is interesting to note that in 1 Corinthians 4 Paul mentions a group of people that were highlighting their rights and privileges as followers of Jesus. They used language like authority of the believer to rule and reign in this world. They took pride in the riches of this world as a sign of God's blessings on their lives.

Paul writes. He describes how God has his treasure in jars of clay. These clay jars show his all-surpassing power and not ours. When he uses the phrase "jars of clay." The people would immediately know what he meant. Clay is common. It is an everyday earthen reality. There is nothing special about the clay itself. Clay is vulnerable. It breaks and cracks easily. Clay is also formed by someone else's hands. The clay vessel does not get to choose what it will become. The potter shapes it into the figure or utensil that he wants it to be.

All of this stands as a beautiful metaphor of the Christian life. We are formed and shaped by God himself. The vessel itself is common. It is the contents of the vessel that truly give it value. But most of all what stands out to me is the vulnerability of the vessel to be cracked and possibly broken. Notice what Paul goes on to say...

> *We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.*

Notice the contents of the vessel...

> *We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.*

By carrying around in our body the death of Jesus it gives us true life. And that true life is revealed through this jar of clay. It is about Him living his life in me and then through me. Hopefully people see in me the hope of glory -- Jesus Christ my Lord.

Lord Jesus it is always hard when I am hard pressed on every side. When I feel like I am being crushed and persecuted and struck down. But thank you that I am never in despair. Never perplexed. Never abandoned nor destroyed. I am in you and you are in me. You give me hope. Thank you. In Jesus name amen.
