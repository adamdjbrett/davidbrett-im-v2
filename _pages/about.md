To be part of a ministry setting that is transformative, relevant, relational, and effective in reaching others with the grace of Christ. To be connected to a church that knows what it means to trade brokenness for wholeness, hurt for healing, and grief for grace. I want to serve with a team of people who are committed to excellence in their love for Christ and their journey of faith. I want to further the kingdom of God through outreach intentionally designed to reach a diverse population. The one passion that drives me in ministry is to the opportunity to help people become fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ. The goals that define my ministry and shape my theology include: leading people to Christ, teaching with spiritual growth in mind, developing gifts in ministry, and empowering people to move forward on the journey of faith.

I am responsible for seeing the integration and retention of visitors and members to the church. Presently the church attracts over 2,000 people. I enjoy speaking in a wide variety of settings including but not limited to Wednesday nights, Sunday mornings, and in small groups. I provide leadership for all pastoral care ministers as well as implementing strategies for growth, administration, and operations of those ministries. One of the ways that I accomplish these goals is though developing and implementing an infrastructure Pastoral care ministries to ensure meaningful hospital visitation and follow-up spiritual guidance. Additionally I connect parish nurses with patients who need in home assistance and continued care. Additional pastoral care and counseling duties include the opportunity to implement teams and provide leadership for the Alpha Marriage Course, oversee the food pantry and Clothing Connection, as well as other distribution of resources like the Benevolence Outreach to those in need. I relish the moments where I am able to provide pastoral care and counseling via appointment and through the ad-hoc encounters of seeing parishioners out in the community. Thanks to the churches location and facilities, I frequently officiate weddings and funerals. Finally I facilitate ministry for grieving families and provide one-on-one spiritual guidance as well as working closely with Celebrate Recovery and providing support for the Prison Ministry and other outreach opportunities.
